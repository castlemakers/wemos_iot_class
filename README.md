# wemos_iot_class

This repository contains the files used in the April 2018 Internet of Things class.

In addition to the sketch, the Castlemakers_WeMos_Temp_Demo directory also contains the contents of the
Adafruit_SSD1306 library, from https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_AAD1306/ -- this is because the
header file for the library needs to be edited to select the correct screen size, and we wanted to avoid
having the class do that.
